<p>we thank you from the deepest of our hearts for your participation in this year’s - and at the same time first - <a href="https://eventyay.com/e/cf85f6e7">SCS Community Summit on December 15, 2021</a>. Though we were originally so much looking forward to meeting you all in person at Cloud Expo in Frankfurt and toasting together on site, the current pandemic situation has forced us to an alternative format. True to the motto <em>8-Bit Retro Edition</em>, this year’s community meeting took place in the specially created <a href="https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/scs-maschinenraum">SCS Maschinenraum</a> and offered virtual space for presentations, discussions and talks. To still create at least some congress feeling, we organized a sticker exchange, so that all participants received an <em>adventure package</em>. Thank you very much for your contributions and support!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephan-ilaender-128b365/">Stephan Ilaender</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-kronlage-dammers-9378a6184/">Felix Kronlage-Dammers</a> kicked off the summit with two keynote talks from the community. We have collected all slides at the end of this blog post.</p>

<p>Afterwards, <a href="/garloff">Kurt Garloff</a>, <a href="/urban">Dr. Manuela Urban</a>, <a href="/lossack">Dirk Loßack</a> and <a href="/itrich">Eduard Itrich</a> gave an overview of the past and eventful year of SCS, presented a travel guide to the Sovereign Cloud Stack community, and an overview of past and upcoming tenders. Again, you’ll find all slides at the end of this blog post.</p>

<h2 id="milestones-for-2022">Milestones for 2022</h2>

<p>The second half of the summit’s morning was work-intensive for everyone: Together we collected and discussed your ideas for the upcoming year on a <a href="https://github.com/aliasaria/scrumblr">scrumblr</a> board. Together with the Product Board, we will now process these in the coming weeks and transfer them to our <a href="https://ms.scs.sovereignit.de/wekan/b/Zi4PKHTuEhugB7bkX/release-planing-r2">public Wekan board</a>. We are already looking forward to tackling these milestones with you very soon!</p>

<h2 id="the-vulnerability">The vulnerability</h2>

<p>On Fri, 2021-12-10, a design issue in the very popular Java library log4j
was reported and assigned <a href="https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/">CVE-2021-44228</a>
with a CVSS score of 10, which is the highest
possible score and thus means that this is a very critical vulnerability.
In short, log4j interprets strings that are being submitted to it
causing lookups via the JNDI interface (intended e.g. to do LDAP name resolution).
If attackers can cause log4j to log attacker controlled strings, these can be used
to trigger these lookups and cause arbitrary java code to be loaded and
executed. This can be used to gain access to the
application that uses log4j and the container/VM that the application
is running in. As log4j is so popular, many Java applications are
affected. At this point in time, all log4j versions prior to
log4j2-2.15(-rc2) are affected.</p>

<p>Our German readers might want to read the excellent summary in the
<a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Cybersicherheitswarnungen/DE/2021/2021-549032-10F2.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=3">BSI advisory</a>.</p>

<h2 id="usage-of-log4j-in-scs">Usage of log4j in SCS</h2>

<p>The main components of Sovereign Cloud Stack do not use Java.
However, there are Java tools used at a few places:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Keycloak (Identity broker)</li>
  <li>Nexus (Mirror manager)</li>
  <li>Elasticsearch (Log analysis tool)</li>
</ol>

<p>Neither <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/9078">keycloak</a>
nor nexus are affected by the log4j vulnerability.</p>

<p>However, Elasticsearch does use log4j. Elasticsearch is rolled out in a
container on the SCS compute nodes by default in SCS deployments to allow for
log analysis.</p>

<h2 id="potential-impact">Potential impact</h2>

<p>Normal users do not interact with the Elasticsearch functionality in SCS;
only operators have access to it. An issue that can be abused by operators
is not a serious threat to SCS environments, as in all practical setups,
the operators have more privileges to affect the environment than they
could gain by exploiting vulnerabilities in Elasticsearch. This might only
be different in environments with very large operational teams and a very
fine-grained operational access role model.</p>

<p>However, we can at this point not exclude the possibility that a name
controlled by the user (such as the name from a resource at OpenStack
or Kubernetes level) gets logged and later on processed by ElasticSearch
and logged again via log4j. If so, a user could cause undesired actions
within the ElasticSearch container. If a potential
attacker could in addition find another exploit to escape the container
confinement, he could take over the SCS deployment.</p>

<h2 id="mitigation-and-fix">Mitigation and fix</h2>

<p>Until a new version of the Elasticsearch container that uses a fixed
log4j is available, we recommend applying the following change:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Change the configuration repository.
In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">environments/kolla/configuration.yml</code>, add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true</code> to the JVM
startup paramters:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   es_java_opts: "-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true {% if es_heap_size %}-Xms{{ es_heap_size }} -Xmx{{ es_heap_size }}{%endif%}"

</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Roll out the changes:
    <ul>
      <li>If you are <em>not</em> using Celery:
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  osism-manager configuration
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>If you are using Celery:
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  osism apply configuration
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(Re)deploy Elasticsearch:
    <ul>
      <li>If you are <em>not</em> using Celery:
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  osism-kolla deploy elastisearch

      </li>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This causes log4j to no longer interpret the input in ways that lookups
can be triggered and thus reliably avoids the vulnerability. Please note that
this setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups</code> is only available in
log4j2 &gt;= 2.10.0, which is fortunately the case in the Elasticsearch container.</p>

<p>When a new Elasticsearch container built with the fixed log4j (2.16 or better 2.17+)
becomes available, we’ll issue a new advisory that describes the deployment of the
new container.</p>

<h2 id="update-2021-12-21-fix-still-valid">Update 2021-12-21: Fix still valid</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, two more security issues around log4j have been reported:
<a href="https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/resources/blog/log4j-vulnerability-cve-2021-45046/">CVE-2021-45046</a>
and <a href="https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/resources/blog/log4j-vulnerability-cve-2021-45105/">CVE-2021-45105</a>.
The former is a context lookup vulnerability (as a variation to the JNDI
lookup vulnerability) while the latter is a Denial of Service attack by
causing an infinite recursion on the context lookup.</p>

<p>The recommended setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true</code>
is still fully mitigating the issues in our environment.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">es_java_opts</code> setting has been configured in the upstream
<a href="https://github.com/osism/ansible-defaults">OSISM/ansible_defaults</a>
repository meanwhile (commit c84f87a6106dd53d08447ac7d5a24b2677da38f0),
so fresh deployments of SCS testbeds or production environments get
the mitigation automatically. You can validate this by logging in to
one of your compute nodes and checking the jvm parameters in the process
list (elastic search container). You should find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true</code>
in the parameter list.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>The second <a href="https://gaia-x.eu/">Gaia-X</a> Summit took place on November 18 and 19, 2021, in which
concepts were introduced of how Gaia-X enables rule-based federated data
ecosystems to emerge and to create a well-functioning, trustworthy basis for
data-based innovation.</p>

<p>The summit was a bit overshadowed by <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/19/scaleway_gaia_x/">Scaleway’s visible exit from Gaia-X</a>.
Scaleway expressed disappointment with the slow progress and believes that the broad
involvement of the hyperscalers is the reason for this and that there is a risk
for the project to develop in the wrong direction and that in the end,
little will be achieved for digital sovereignty.</p>

<p>This was picked up sporadically in the press. It has been viewed as evidence
for the long-held suspicion that Gaia-X as an initiative initiated by
politics, as a club of large corporations, as an initiative embraced by the
hyperscalers, as a dish with too many cooks was thus bound to fail.</p>

<p>We, as <a href="https://scs.community">SCS project</a>, continue to believe in Gaia-X’s goals. While some
shortcomings exist, we have no reason to dismiss Gaia-X as an important and
useful initiative.</p>

<h2 id="cooperation-between-osb-alliance-and-gaia-x">Cooperation between OSB Alliance and Gaia-X</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://osb-alliance.com">Open Source Business Alliance</a> (OSB Alliance, OSBA) has been a Gaia-X member since summer 2021, but has
already accompanied the founding process of the Gaia-X project through personal
commitment and OSBA members such as PlusServer since the beginning of 2020.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://scs.community/">Sovereign Cloud Stack</a> project, the OSB Alliance is leading a significant project
funded by the <a href="https://bmwi.de/">BMWi</a> (German Ministry for Economic
Affairs and Energy) and provides technology that makes it much easier for
infrastructure operators to provide Gaia-X-compliant, sovereign infrastructure.
As such, it is involved in some Gaia-X working groups with its community and its
employees and helps shaping the work, e.g. in the provider working group.
The SCS project is also anchored here as an open work package.</p>

<h2 id="expectations-and-gaia-x-reality">Expectations and Gaia-X reality</h2>

<p>The expectations of Gaia-X are high and very varied. In some cases
unrealistically high, to which statements such as “Moonshot” have
certainly contributed. In many cases, goals were projected onto Gaia-X that did
not correspond to reality at all, such as the hope that a European hyperscaler
would be created through government intervention with the help of Gaia-X to
push back the worrisome influence of the American platforms.</p>

<p>The approach of Gaia-X is different: Verifiable standards are created to
provide transparency, which then allows services from
different providers to be combined automatically. The transparency should not
only ensure technical compatibility and describe the corresponding
interfaces, but in particular also contain aspects such as control, security
and data protection. This enables users to make a conscious decision as to
which combination of offers meets their requirements. The transparency on
the compliance with European data protection regulations thus also allows legally compliant use.
The transparency is provided via certifiable and verifiable
self-descriptions, which are kept in a catalog by the federator.
Self-descriptions are defined in the corresponding Gaia-X working groups,
filled out by the service provider and, if necessary, checked and confirmed by
certifiers (Conformance Assessment Bodies). An open source implementation of a
distributed catalog is being created, among other things, in the
<a href="https://gxfs.de/">Gaia-X Federation Services</a> (GXFS) project -
another project funded by the BMWi to strengthen Gaia-X.</p>

<p>The path to these standards is not an easy one. Many contributors have to come
to a consensus in order to achieve both good quality as well as broad support by
the stakeholders. This
may be frustrating at times, but it is in the nature of things. A dominant
company with an integrated architecture can advance faster than an ecosystem in
which several actors at different levels have to agree on common
interoperable interfaces. With a top-down approach, you make decisions faster
than with broad participation. This does not make them any better - in the long
term, the arduous path is the more effective. It is important that the
professional competence from the practical implementation is also included in
the decisions and that the processes run transparently. Communication is not
always easy in rapidly growing structures like Gaia-X, but things are moving
forward.</p>

<h2 id="gaia-x-is-not-just-theory">Gaia-X is not just theory</h2>

<p>All theory remains theory if nobody puts it into practice. In fact, there is a
lot of discussion about concepts and standards in the working groups and
committees of the Gaia-X entity and thus far little implementation is visible yet.
In our experience, good, practicable and accepted standards are
almost always created in close exchange and in an iterative process between
theory and practice. A desired side effect is the creation of visibility and
the attention to the goals of Gaia-X. For the needed open standards, a fully open
(reference) implementation will need to be created.</p>

<p>But the reality in Gaia-X is better than it appears at first glance. There are some groups
working on the implementation of Gaia-X concepts. There are the major projects
funded by the BMWi such as e.g. <a href="https://gxfs.de/">GXFS</a>:
There, based on detailed specifications, code on the topics
of compliance, data sovereignty services, identity &amp; trust, federated catalog
and the portal is to be developed. The Sovereign Cloud Stack Project (SCS,
https://scs.community/) published Release 1 in September 2021 and is already
being used in production by cloud providers. SCS is being developed as
completely free software by an open community in an open process. GXFS is also
under an OSS license.</p>

<p>There are also the French project to supplement the Federation Services,
projects from the BMWi funding competition, the Eclipse Data Connector, work in
Catena-X and numerous initiatives by companies and groups around Gaia-X. Many
of them come together in the work package “Minimal Viable Gaia” and take part
in the second Gaia-X Hackathon on the 2nd + 3rd. December - technology is
actually developed and tested there.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Unfortunately, little of this was visible at the Gaia-X Summit - the presentation
of the highlights from the hackathon there didn’t work out
because of the ordering of the events on the schedule.</p>

<h2 id="labels-beyond-data-protection">Labels beyond data protection</h2>

<p>The concept of so-called labels was presented at the Gaia-X Summit. These are
the certificates with which services and providers show their conformity with
Gaia-X standards. Behind this are criteria and the associated test catalogs,
which must be verified accordingly (ideally in an automated manner). It will be
necessary to look closely at the details - of course, the goals of a high level
of transparency and digital sovereignty would not only be missed but even
counteracted by too soft criteria catalogs.</p>

<p>It makes sense to have different levels of conformity. This also includes and
makes transparent offers that do not meet high standards in the area of
data protection. Interoperability and transparency are still an
added value - not all IT services and data have high data protection and
sovereignty requirements. US-American hyperscalers can also make a valuable
contribution at this level.</p>

<p>The three levels of <em>basic</em>, <em>substantial</em> and <em>high</em> outlined in Gaia-X are based on
the corresponding levels of ENISA in the European Cybersecurity Scheme for
Cloud Services. At the highest level, access from outside Europe would be
excluded with a high degree of certainty - this can only be guaranteed with
platforms that are completely under the operational control of European
companies.</p>

<p>This means that the area of data protection is well reflected by Gaia-X Labels and
it makes sense to link them to proven standards in this area.</p>

<p>However, digital sovereignty goes far beyond data protection.</p>

<p>The ability to innovate on and design digital platforms requires the ability to
give users control over the technology and its implementation. This can hardly
be achieved with proprietary technology stacks, but requires complete
openness. This is exactly what we are working on in the Sovereign
Cloud Stack project and see the combination with other free technologies from the
Gaia-X environment (and in the future the planned IPCEI-CIS) such as GXFS as an attractive
combination for companies to provide federated, interoperable and completely
sovereign services for their own use or for third parties.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this important aspect of digital sovereignty has not yet been
taken into account in the description of the Gaia-X labels - we expect that
further development will take place here and are also working towards this as
part of our cooperation in the Gaia-X working groups and open work packages.</p>

<p>Gaia-X is a large project that is collaboratively built. It requires support
from many parties and a long term perspective. But that is also its strength.</p>]]></content><author><name>Kurt Garloff</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[(By Dr. Manuela Urban, Felix Kronlage-Dammers, Jonas Schäfer, Kurt Garloff)]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://scs.community/assets/images/blog/rowing.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://scs.community/assets/images/blog/rowing.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">SCS R1 released</title><link href="https://scs.community/release/2021/10/05/release1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SCS R1 released" /><published>2021-10-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-31T10:07:20+00:00</updated><id>https://scs.community/release/2021/10/05/release1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://scs.community/release/2021/10/05/release1/"><![CDATA[<p>After R0 has been released in July and focused on the installation of a <a href="https://docs.osism.tech/testbed/">test environment</a>, the release R1 of Sovereign Cloud Stack was released last Wednesday, 2021-09-29.</p>

<p>The newest release R1 includes the <a href="https://releases.openstack.org/wallaby/">OpenStack Wallaby Release</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases">Kubernetes version v1.21.x</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/releases">Kubernetes Cluster API version v0.4</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/blob/main/Release-Notes/Release1.md">full release notes</a> including technical details can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs">central docs repository</a> of the SCS project on GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="kubernetes-cluster-as-self-service-thanks-to-cluster-api">Kubernetes cluster as self-service thanks to cluster API</h2>

<p>A special focus during this sprint was on the management of Kubernetes containers based on the k8s Cluster API, which was integrated in version Alpha 4. Both through the conformance tests of the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> using <a href="https://sonobuoy.io/">sonobouy</a>, and in real-world use during the <a href="https://www.gaia-x.eu/news/gaia-x-hackathon-1-new-technology-develops-live-today-and-tomorrow">first Gaia-X Hackathon</a> on August 30 and 31, 2021, the maturity of SCS’s k8s cluster management was tested and determined for productive systems.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With the Kubernetes Cluster API, DevOps teams can create and manage Kubernetes clusters for development, for test and staging, and for production environments on-thy-fly. Of course, the cloud operator can also offer a managed service to its users via the same technology. Detailed <a href="https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/blob/master/Release-Notes-R1.md">release information on SCS’s k8s-cluster-api-provider</a> can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider">corresponding repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="sovereign-operation-through-monitoring-and-logging">Sovereign operation through monitoring and logging</h2>

<p>The Sovereign Cloud Stack project’s Monitoring Special Interest Group has collected <a href="https://github.com/osism/kolla-operations">various examples of monitoring SCS environments</a>. The blueprints for Prometheus exporter, rules and Grafana dashboards can be used by providers after appropriate customization to ensure low-threshold, high-quality operation of their own SCS platform.</p>

<figure class="figure mx-auto d-block" style="width:90%">

  </a>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">
    With R1, easy-to-use dashboards are available.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For the upcoming release, we plan to integrate these blueprints directly into the testbed deployment and also make them available to the OpenStack upstream community. We particularly welcome feedback on the examples integrated in release R1 and, in addition, suggestions on other essential operational tools.</p>

<p>With the current version of OSISM in release R1, centralized logging is now also enabled by default. The logging rules still have to be adapted by the provider according to his environment. Similar to monitoring, we also plan to publish already tested rules in the area of logging as a blueprint with the upcoming releases.</p>

<h2 id="a-federated-and-secure-data-platform">A federated and secure data platform</h2>

<p>Authentication against Horizon, the OpenStack standard web interface for using an SCS Cloud, can additionally be realized with <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> via the integrated identity and access management solution Keycloak. This enables federation across multiple cloud service providers, in line with the vision of Gaia-X.</p>

<p>For the following release R2, we plan to work further on the high availability of the IAM service, which could not be fully tested at the time of the release in its current implementation based on Galera Cluster.</p>

<h2 id="automated-distribution-on-bare-metal">Automated distribution on bare metal</h2>

<p>For automated distribution of the Sovereign Cloud stack on physical hardware, the <a href="https://ironicbaremetal.org/">ironic</a> service can be installed using OSISM. To enable prior testing of the automated deployment, a virtual BMC service has been integrated, so that bare metal deployments can also be tested in the testbed. The main building blocks are already available upstream, but were not fully integrated into R1 due to the short timing of the release.</p>

<h2 id="further-announcements-about-the-project">Further announcements about the project</h2>

<p>Following the successful engagement of the SCS community in the first Gaia-X Hackathon, concrete plans are already being made for the second Hackathon on December 2 and 3, 2021. This will feature a dedicated two-day session in which a fully sovereign cloud will be built from scratch. Interested cloud architects are invited to join us in installing and running SCS hands-on on real hardware.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/logo-greencis.png" class="float-left" alt="GREEN-CIS" style="width:300px;" /></p>

<p>In addition, as part of the “Important Project of Common European Interest - Cloud Infrastructure and Services” (IPCEI-CIS), the SCS project is actively participating in the so-called GREEN-CIS consortium, short for “General Purpose Resilient and Secure Energy Efficient Computing Infrastructure Network”. This growing alliance of a total of 28 industry and research partners has set itself the goal of developing and building a virtual, sustainable cloud edge system operating as a single entity based on a decentralized, multi-provider ecosystem. In this regard, we are pleased to receive positive feedback from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, which will send the GREEN-CIS consortium together with 21 other projects to the European matchmaking event on October 06, 2021.</p>

<p>The Sovereign Cloud Stack project will play a central role as an open and sovereign cloud technology and will serve as the basis for further platform services as well as for a modern edge cloud.</p>]]></content><author><name>Sovereign Cloud Stack</name></author><category term="release" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After R0 has been released in July and focused on the installation of a test environment, the release R1 of Sovereign Cloud Stack was released last Wednesday, 2021-09-29.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://scs.community/assets/images/default-card.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://scs.community/assets/images/default-card.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Do you know the secret of sustainable Open Source projects?</title><link href="https://scs.community/2021/09/29/run2021/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Do you know the secret of sustainable Open Source projects?" /><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-31T10:07:20+00:00</updated><id>https://scs.community/2021/09/29/run2021</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://scs.community/2021/09/29/run2021/"><![CDATA[<p>We’ll tell you! 🤫</p>

<p>R0 is the culmination of more than a year of work, all of which can be found on
github. <a href="https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/">SCS</a> heavily relies on
<a href="https://github.com/OSISM/">OSISM</a>, so we actually are building on top of
many years of work there. A lot of the SCS work got integrated back into it.
SCS and OSISM of course build on top of thousands of person years
of upstream communities’ work. We are standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>

<p>We are really proud with what we achieved with our volunteer community!  The
automation for the lifecycle management of the (containerized) base
infrastructure, the operations tooling, IAM and the IaaS layer is rock solid.
The first two partners, <a href="https://betacloud.de">betacloud</a> and
<a href="https://www.plusserver.com/en/products/pluscloud">PlusServer</a> are already
using this for their productive clouds and more are in the pipeline.
We have been monitoring the demonstrator (gx-scs) environment from PlusCloudOpen
with <a href="https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/openstack-health-monitor">openstack-health-monitor</a>
and have seen only one slowliness warning in weeks and not a single alarm.
This is no small feat.</p>

<p>Thanks to anyone who contributed to this nice release!</p>

<p>R0 focuses on <a href="https://docs.osism.tech/testbed/">testbed</a> deployments – we
want to make it easy for anyone to use SCS for testing, inspection,
contribution, comparison, inspiration, … at this stage. This in no way should
discourage anyone from a production deployment on bare metal – as mentioned we
have two cloud providers already using it. Exploring testbed is typically the
first stage though. Get in touch with us if you have made yourself familiar
with SCS via testbed already and want to move to the next stage.</p>

<p>We have updated a lot of documents in the last days. Use our
<a href="https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/">github Docs</a> as entry point.
There are specific
<a href="https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/blob/main/Release-Notes/Release0.md">release notes for R0</a>.
You can of course also find this from the <a href="/get">“Get SCS”</a>
page from our <a href="">web site</a>.</p>

<p>The documents explain how to perform a testbed installation and also how to use
the Technical Preview pieces such as the Kubernetes aaS pieces using the
<a href="https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider">k8s-cluster-api</a>.
This will be one of the focus areas for R1 which we already
plan for September. (Note: We’ll have a 6 month release cycle going forward,
though the reality is more continuous than this sounds.)</p>

forced to store and process very sensitive data in clouds whose functionality
they cannot check or adapt to their needs. This results in a loss of control
and strong technological dependencies on individual, large providers. With the
Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS), the Open Source Business Alliance (OSB Alliance)
is now developing the technical underpinning for Gaia-X to enable complete
digital sovereignty.</p>

<p>The SCS project was initiated in November 2019 by OSB Alliance CEO Peter
Ganten, a leading cloud architect Kurt Garloff, the Director of the German
Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation, Rafael Laguna de la Vera and former
PlusServer CEO Dr. Oliver Mauss. The project was initially evaluated with
funding by the German Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation SPRIND and is
now receiving 14.9M€ of federal funding from the Federal Ministry for Economic
Affairs and Energy (BMWi) to develop and build the Sovereign Cloud Stack.</p>

<p>To this end, the Open Source Business Alliance is building a growing team that
will manage and coordinate standardisation, software integration and the
development of the network. A community of employees from participating and
interested companies has already been formed around this team, who are working
in particular on the goals that are important for their own environments.
Important building blocks will also be awarded to companies through open
tenders. In addition, the OSB Alliance will build and operate its own test,
demo and development platform.</p>

<p>Participation in SCS is not limited to members of the OSB Alliance. This is
because only a multitude of providers within and outside the OSB Alliance will
allow the industry to use modern and agile IT infrastructures without the
strategic, economic and legal risks of using hyperscaler services from the USA
and China. SCS components and standards will enable development teams to
achieve the flexibility, speed and ultimately productivity that is rightly
expected from modern IT infrastructure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the heart of the first wave of digitalisation were centralised platforms
with serious negative consequences for data security, innovation capability and
the independence of their users. The Sovereign Cloud Stack project makes a
decisive contribution as a basis for the second wave of digitalisation that is
now following, with open, federatable technologies that can be deployed without
requiring permission by 3rd parties. User organisations can thus freely switch
between providers or also decide to produce parts of their IT infrastructure
and services under their own control. This creates an open platform for
innovative applications and services that enables competition, promotes
innovation and does not have problems like the Cloud Act.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the Sovereign Cloud Stack, the GAIA-X project is increasingly being
filled with life. As a contribution to European digital sovereignty, the
technical foundation, the Cloud Stack, is to be implemented as an open source
project in order to enable switching providers in the future. It will make it
easier for medium-sized companies, but also for public administrations, to use
the advantages of GAIA-X in specific projects. The Sovereign Cloud Stack will
be closely linked to the core components of GAIA-X, the so-called Federation
Services, the creation of which is also funded by the BMWi and is well
advanced. Together with other funding measures such as the GAIA-X funding
competition or for future investments in the vehicle industry (KoPa35c), the
BMWi is lending considerable momentum to the implementation of GAIA-X.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We actually have all the building blocks for a powerful cloud and container
stack available as open source software in reasonable quality. But assembling
them consistently and ensuring the quality and security of the resulting
infrastructure with continuous test processes is a lot of work that requires a
large amount of specialised knowledge. And then comes the bigger half of the
work: the platforms have to be secured in operation by automation and mature
processes. Integration, continuous testing, operational automation and the
development of operational processes are carried out independently of each
other in many companies and cloud providers today. With SCS, we are networking
these efforts with the goal of avoiding a large amount of work being done in
isolation or in parallel. In addition to collaborating in Open Source software
development, we are also establishing cooperation in operations, which we call
Open Operations. As a result, we achieve a much more powerful stack with higher
quality and higher standardisation. The latter is especially important for
users who run applications on multiple clouds or rely on a mix of self-operated
SCS clouds and public SCS offerings.</p>

<em>Rafael Laguna de la Vera, Director of the German Federal Agency for Disruptive
Innovation (SPRIND):</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Sovereign Cloud Stack is an excellent example of how government
intervention can fix a market that no longer works. This is because although
the dominant cloud providers from the US all predominantly use open source
software in their proprietary cloud stacks, there is no fair competition today
because switching between different providers is burdensome and expensive. SCS
removes the ‘vendor lock-in’ and ensures that smaller providers with innovative
solutions also have a chance.</p>

<em>Alexander Wallner, CEO, plusserver:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the Sovereign Cloud Stack, we are bundling the strengths of many open
source projects to create a powerful and holistic cloud stack. In this way we
are creating a technology platform that will hopefully quickly become a new
cloud standard. For cloud providers such as plusserver, the SCS is an important
component for technological and economic independence. For companies and other
users, the SCS ensures that they can move their services freely between the
platforms of different providers. This is how we promote competition in the
European cloud market.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sovereign Cloud Stack delivers a significant contribution to avoid European
Cloud Providers to annihilate each other in fighting, but instead allows them
to join forces in cooperation. We hope for an ecosystem that develops and
operates cloud offerings together. As provider of sustainable and secure
digital infrastructure, we currently face the challenge of creating a highly
scalable operations model for our technology stack. To cooperatively include
the competence of other operators, we need a cloud platform with common
technological and operational standards, which is developed as part of the SCS
project.</p>

<p>The Open Source Business Alliance (OSB Alliance) is the association of the open
source industry in Germany. We represent over 170 member companies that employ
approximately 10,000 people and generate more than 1.7 billion euros annually
in Germany. Together with scientific institutions and user organisations, we
are committed to sustainably anchoring the central importance of open source
software and open standards for a successful digital transformation in the
public awareness. This digital transformation should benefit companies, the
state and society alike. In addition, innovations in the field of open source
should be promoted. Our goal is to establish open source as the standard in
public procurement and in research and business promotion. After all, open
source and open standards are essential foundations for digital sovereignty,
innovative capacity and security in the digital transformation and thus the
answer to one of the greatest challenges of our time.</p>

as public institutions in a GAIA-X working package, tackling the standardization
and implementation of a common stack for a cloud- and container platform, providing
an option for a sovereign underpinning for higher-level services in the GAIA-X project.

<p>Two of our SCS partners, OVH and T-Systems, announced yesterday that they will
collaborate closely even beyond the joint work in SCS and GAIA-X and the collaboration
will cover hardware, data centers, operations and the software stack.</p>

<p>I have been asked how that interacts with SCS and I have reached out to both partners
to ensure there is no change in course how they work with us. And there is not.</p>

<p>I really congratulate OVH and T-Systems on this deal!
It’s great to see them collaborate even beyond the scope of GAIA-X.
It will help those two large providers to gain speed in implementing SCS
and in establishing a truly open alternative in the market.</p>]]></content><author><name>Kurt Garloff</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[SCS is a collaboration of many companies from the industrial and ICT sector as well as public institutions in a GAIA-X working package, tackling the standardization and implementation of a common stack for a cloud- and container platform, providing an option for a sovereign underpinning for higher-level services in the GAIA-X project.
