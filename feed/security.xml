<h2 id="the-vulnerability">The vulnerability</h2>

<p>On Fri, 2021-12-10, a design issue in the very popular Java library log4j
was reported and assigned <a href="https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/">CVE-2021-44228</a>
with a CVSS score of 10, which is the highest
possible score and thus means that this is a very critical vulnerability.
In short, log4j interprets strings that are being submitted to it
causing lookups via the JNDI interface (intended e.g. to do LDAP name resolution).
If attackers can cause log4j to log attacker controlled strings, these can be used
to trigger these lookups and cause arbitrary java code to be loaded and
executed. This can be used to gain access to the
application that uses log4j and the container/VM that the application
is running in. As log4j is so popular, many Java applications are
affected. At this point in time, all log4j versions prior to
log4j2-2.15(-rc2) are affected.</p>

<p>Our German readers might want to read the excellent summary in the
<a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Cybersicherheitswarnungen/DE/2021/2021-549032-10F2.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=3">BSI advisory</a>.</p>

<h2 id="usage-of-log4j-in-scs">Usage of log4j in SCS</h2>

<p>The main components of Sovereign Cloud Stack do not use Java.
However, there are Java tools used at a few places:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Keycloak (Identity broker)</li>
  <li>Nexus (Mirror manager)</li>
  <li>Elasticsearch (Log analysis tool)</li>
</ol>

<p>Neither <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/9078">keycloak</a>
nor nexus are affected by the log4j vulnerability.</p>

<p>However, Elasticsearch does use log4j. Elasticsearch is rolled out in a
container on the SCS compute nodes by default in SCS deployments to allow for
log analysis.</p>

<h2 id="potential-impact">Potential impact</h2>

<p>Normal users do not interact with the Elasticsearch functionality in SCS;
only operators have access to it. An issue that can be abused by operators
is not a serious threat to SCS environments, as in all practical setups,
the operators have more privileges to affect the environment than they
could gain by exploiting vulnerabilities in Elasticsearch. This might only
be different in environments with very large operational teams and a very
fine-grained operational access role model.</p>

<p>However, we can at this point not exclude the possibility that a name
controlled by the user (such as the name from a resource at OpenStack
or Kubernetes level) gets logged and later on processed by ElasticSearch
and logged again via log4j. If so, a user could cause undesired actions
within the ElasticSearch container. If a potential
attacker could in addition find another exploit to escape the container
confinement, he could take over the SCS deployment.</p>

<h2 id="mitigation-and-fix">Mitigation and fix</h2>

<p>Until a new version of the Elasticsearch container that uses a fixed
log4j is available, we recommend applying the following change:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Change the configuration repository.
In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">environments/kolla/configuration.yml</code>, add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true</code> to the JVM
startup paramters:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   es_java_opts: "-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true {% if es_heap_size %}-Xms{{ es_heap_size }} -Xmx{{ es_heap_size }}{%endif%}"

</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Roll out the changes:
    <ul>
      <li>If you are <em>not</em> using Celery:
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  osism-manager configuration
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>If you are using Celery:
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  osism apply configuration
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(Re)deploy Elasticsearch:
    <ul>
      <li>If you are <em>not</em> using Celery:
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  osism-kolla deploy elastisearch
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>If you are using Celery:
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  osism apply elasticsearch
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This causes log4j to no longer interpret the input in ways that lookups
can be triggered and thus reliably avoids the vulnerability. Please note that
this setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups</code> is only available in
log4j2 &gt;= 2.10.0, which is fortunately the case in the Elasticsearch container.</p>

<p>When a new Elasticsearch container built with the fixed log4j (2.16 or better 2.17+)
becomes available, weâ€™ll issue a new advisory that describes the deployment of the
new container.</p>

<h2 id="update-2021-12-21-fix-still-valid">Update 2021-12-21: Fix still valid</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, two more security issues around log4j have been reported:
<a href="https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/resources/blog/log4j-vulnerability-cve-2021-45046/">CVE-2021-45046</a>
and <a href="https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/resources/blog/log4j-vulnerability-cve-2021-45105/">CVE-2021-45105</a>.
The former is a context lookup vulnerability (as a variation to the JNDI
lookup vulnerability) while the latter is a Denial of Service attack by
causing an infinite recursion on the context lookup.</p>

<p>The recommended setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true</code>
is still fully mitigating the issues in our environment.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">es_java_opts</code> setting has been configured in the upstream
<a href="https://github.com/osism/ansible-defaults">OSISM/ansible_defaults</a>
repository meanwhile (commit c84f87a6106dd53d08447ac7d5a24b2677da38f0),
so fresh deployments of SCS testbeds or production environments get
the mitigation automatically. You can validate this by logging in to
one of your compute nodes and checking the jvm parameters in the process
list (elastic search container). You should find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true</code>
in the parameter list.</p>
